          <h4>ACTS is a book in the Bible that is full of accounts of ordinary people who have been touched by Jesus, empowered by the Holy Spirit, gone out there, and done the extraordinary for God. One thing compels them - that all might see and hear of the Good News of Jesus. 
          This year, join us at Hope Conference 2014 as we zoom in on ACTS. Come and get ready to be renewed, refreshed and refuelled for God’s mission!</h4>
